Print out  "I'm on <count number>".  Count by ones from exactly -3 up to and including 3.  If the absolute value of the count is equal to 1, add three question marks.  Do this twice: once with a while loop, and again with a for loop. 

Example Output:

I'm on -3
I'm on -2
I'm on -1???
I'm on -0
I'm on 1???
I'm on 2
I'm on 3

a) Do this once using a while loop.
